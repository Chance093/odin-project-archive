# odin-project-tic-tac-toe
This is my Tic Tac Toe project for The Odin Project. The point of this project was to practice organizing my code. I used a factory function to create both of my player objects, and then I used modules to organize the rest of my code into several groups. This took me awhile but I eventually got the hang of how modules work. I will probably come back to this project and build an unbeatable AI, but I am just moving on for now.

Here is the live preview of the game:
