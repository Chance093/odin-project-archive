    <h2>Here is how to make a beautiful homemade Japanese Curry!</h2>
    <p>Curry has always been a passion of mine, especially Japanese Curry. After years of searching I have discovered
        the perfect Japanese Curry. Many of these spices can be found at your local Asian, Hispanic, or Middle Eastern
        markets, or substituted with S&BÂ® Oriental Curry Powder. Well worth the effort - your family will love this!
        Serve over steamed rice or noodles.</p>
